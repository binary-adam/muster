A big part of Muster is handling collections of items. In Muster, any node can be an item in a collection, but the most common types of node used are `value()` and `tree()`.

## Types of collection
Muster comes bundled with a two types of collections:
  - `array()` - A fixed-length collection; similar to an array in Java. Once defined, this collection can't change its size, but its items still can be set (with the use of a `variable()` and `set()` nodes)
  - `arrayList()` - A dynamic-length collection; similar to an ArrayList in Java. This collection supports a number of length-changing operations:
    * `push()` - Adds a new item to the back of the collection
    * `pop()` - Removes an item from the back of the collection
    * `unshift()` - Adds a new item at the front of the collection
    * `shift()` - Removes an item from the front of the collection
    * `addItemAt()` - Adds an item at a given index of the collection
    * `clear()` - Removes all items from the collection
    * `removeItem()` - Removes a given item from the collection
    * `removeItemAt()` - Removes an item at a given index
    * `removeItems()` - Removes item that match a given predicate

Aside from collections having different types, every collection can also be transformed using a number of transforms you might be familiar from different programming languages:
  - `map()`
  - `filter()`
  - `count()`
  - `sort()`
  - `take()`
  - `slice()`
  - `groupBy()`
  - `skip()`

and a few more

Only some of these transforms will be covered in this tutorial just to give you a feel for how to use them. For more information on different collection transforms please refer to Muster API docs.

## Arrays
Now, for the fun part; time to make a simple `array()` node:
```javascript
import muster from '@dws/muster';

const app = muster({
  numbers: [1, 2, 3],
});
```
The code above relies on an implicit conversion from a JS array to an `array()` node. An explicitly defined array would look like this:
```javascript
import muster, { array, value } from '@dws/muster';

const app = muster({
  numbers: array([value(1), value(2), value(3)]),
});
```
The `array()` node hides one more secret when it comes to implicit conversion of objects:
```javascript
import muster from '@dws/muster';

const app = muster({
  fruits: [
    { name: 'Banana' },
    { name: 'Apple' },
    { name: 'Plum' },
  ],
});
```
Any items that are objects are converted to `tree()` nodes. This means that an explicitly declared object array would look like this:
```javascript
import muster, { array, tree, value } from '@dws/muster';

const app = muster({
  fruits: array([
    tree({ name: value('Banana') }),
    tree({ name: value('Apple') }),
    tree({ name: value('Plum') }),
  ]),
});
```
An introduction into loading collections in Muster is described below in the section containing the `query()` node.


## Querying items from a collection

To get data from a collection, a `query()` must be defined against it. This is because each item can be a `tree()` node, and in Muster "Get me the whole tree" doesn't make any sense. When getting data from a `tree()` you have to be explicit in terms of what to get from it.

Let's make a simple query to get items from a collection containing primitive items (`value()` nodes):
```javascript
import muster, { entries, query, root } from '@dws/muster';

const app = muster({
  numbers: [1, 2, 3],
});

const result = await app.resolve(query(root(), {
  numbers: entries(),
}));
console.log(result);

// Console output:
// [1, 2, 3]
```
This example introduces a new Muster node - `entries()`. The only use for this node is as part of the `query()` node definition, and it is used to indicate to the `query()` node that a given node should be loaded as a collection of items.

The `entries()` node has one optional argument that defines the shape of each item, but not specifying it tells the `query()` that it is supposed to expect these items to be primitive items (`value()`).

The following code fragment shows how to make a `query()` against a collection containing `tree()` nodes:
```javascript
import muster, { entries, query, root } from '@dws/muster';

const app = muster({
  people: [
    { firstName: 'Bob', lastName: 'Smith' },
    { firstName: 'Kate', lastName: 'Doe' },
    { firstName: 'Jane', lastName: 'Jonson' },
  ],
});

const result = await app.resolve(query(root(), {
 people: entries({
   firstName: true,
 }),
}));
console.log(result);

// Console output:
// {
//   people: [
//     { firstName: 'Bob' },
//     { firstName: 'Kate' },
//     { firstName: 'Jane' },
//   ]
// }
```
Note that the returned items contain only `firstName` property, as this is the only property that was requested from the item.

## Requesting values of multiple nodes at the same time

Until now, when requesting nodes we've been using the simple `ref()` node to request a single value at a time from our graph. To avoid duplicating code with several `ref()` nodes, the `query()` node comes in handy. It's a node that is used when making a query for multiple pieces of data, arranged in a tree-like structure. Let's start small:
```javascript
import muster, { query, root } from '@dws/muster';

const app = muster({
  firstName: 'Bob',
  lastName: 'Smith',
  age: 25,
});

const result = await app.resolve(query(root(), {
  firstName: true,
  lastName: true,
}));
console.log(result);

// Console output:
// { firstName: 'Bob', lastName: 'Smith' }
```
In this example, the `query()` node only requests a subset of the full Muster graph, the `firstName` and `lastName` branches.

The `query()` node is constructed by first providing the root node of the query - in this case we use a `root()` node. The `root()` node serves as a kind of meta-node which always resolves to the top-most node of the application graph. In this example the `root()` node resolves to:
```javascript
tree({
  firstName: value('Bob'),
  lastName: value('Smith'),
  age: value(25),
})
```
The root of the `query()` node can also be set to any other node to define the top-level branch to query from.


The second argument of `query()` is a node that defines the shape of nodes to extract. Some [implicit conversion](/muster/docs/understanding-muster/03-explicit-definition#explicit-query-definitions) is performed to keep the syntax as legible as possible.

The query we ended up creating informs Muster that we'd like to load `firstName` and `lastName` from the root of our graph fields. These fields should first resolve to a non-error node that doesn't implement `evaluate` operation.

A `query()` node can also be used when loading nested data structures from the graph:
```javascript
import muster, { computed, query, ref, root } from '@dws/muster';

const app = muster({
  user: {
    age: 25,
    firstName: 'Bob',
    lastName: 'Smith',
    fullName: computed(
      [ref('user', 'firstName'), ref('user', 'lastName')],
      (firstName, lastName) => `${firstName} ${lastName}`,
    ),
  },
});

const result = await app.resolve(query(root(), {
  user: {
    age: true,
    fullName: true,
  },
}));
console.log(result);

// Console output:
// {
//   user: {
//     age: 25,
//     fullName: 'Bob Smith',
//   },
// }
```
The query constructed requests two fields (`age` and `fullName`) from the `user` tree, which can be observed in the result received from Muster.

Again, in the previous example, the `query()` node created uses a `root()` node as the root of the query, but now that there is nesting in the graph the query could be rewritten to use `user` as the starting point:
```javascript
import muster, { computed, query, ref } from '@dws/muster';

const app = muster({
  user: {
    age: 25,
    firstName: 'Bob',
    lastName: 'Smith',
    fullName: computed(
      [ref('user', 'firstName'), ref('user', 'lastName')],
      (firstName, lastName) => `${firstName} ${lastName}`,
    ),
  },
});

const result = await app.resolve(query(ref('user'), {
  age: true,
  fullName: true,
}));
console.log(result);

// Console output:
// {
//   age: 25,
//   fullName: 'Bob Smith',
// }
```
The `query()` node created in this example sets is root as `ref('user')`, which means that the `fields` part of the query now is defined relative to the `user` branch. Also, note that the output no longer has the `user: {}` object, and that the `age` and `fullName` properties are present directly inside the top-level object.
